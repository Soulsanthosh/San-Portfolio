          <h2>Why Full-Stack Development?</h2>
          <p>As a full-stack developer, I love the challenge of understanding both the front and back ends of an application. 
            It's incredibly rewarding to work on a project from start to finish,from designing databases and creating server-side logic to implementing beautiful, interactive user interfaces. 
            Iâ€™m always eager to learn new tools and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve and ensure my projects are both high-performing and maintainable.</p>
